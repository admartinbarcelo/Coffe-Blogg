Gesha coffee, also known as Geisha, is a unique and highly prized type of coffee. It was first found in the Gesha village in Ethiopia and is now famous around the world for its excellent quality and special taste.

This coffee is known for its amazing flavor, which includes floral and tea-like notes. It has a rich aroma with touches of jasmine, bergamot, and tropical fruits. People often say its taste is lively, clean, and very smooth, with just the right amount of acidity. The special taste of Gesha coffee comes from the area where it's grown, including the high altitude, soil, and climate.

Gesha coffee became really popular after it was grown in Panama's Boquete region. In 2004, a coffee producer named Hacienda La Esmeralda introduced it to the specialty coffee market. It quickly amazed coffee lovers and experts with its unique taste. Since then, it's been known as a luxury coffee and is one of the best in the world.

Gesha coffee is rare and in high demand, so it's usually expensive. The careful way it's grown and made, along with the small amount harvested, makes it special. Coffee fans look forward to its yearly release to enjoy its special flavors and the top-notch quality of coffee making.

In short, Gesha coffee shows the amazing variety and quality in the coffee world. Its special taste, coming from the Gesha area, has won over coffee lovers everywhere. With its refined taste and luxury status, Gesha coffee is a truly special drink that keeps setting high standards in the coffee industry.
